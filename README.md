# HackingToolkit3DS

With this tool, you'll be able to:
- Extract and Rebuild any .3DS file (previously decrypted using Decrypt9WIP and my tutorial)
- Extract and Rebuild any .CIA file (previously decrypted using Decrypt9WIP and my tutorial) (No DLC atm)
- Extract any .CXI file (previously dumped using Braindump and my tutorial)
- Extract and Rebuild a 3DS banner filer (shown on the 3DS home menu)
- Mass Decrypt and Mass Rebuild any .3DS and .CIA files in the same time. Yes, sir.
- Extract any ncch partition from a .3DS decrypted file (Soon CIA support too)
- Extract datas from a decrypted ncch binary file


Are included some shortcuts of:
- 3DS Builder
- Pokemon Patch Pointer Tool
- RomFS Builder
- RomFS Extractor

<p>Like that you don't have to take them in any folder or search for them.</p>
<p>Just call them using the right keys (check the main menu).</p>

The main tutorial can be found here:

Before report an issue, be sure your .3DS, .CIA or CXI are fully decrypted, and doesn't have any space or special caracters in their names (such as é or à).
