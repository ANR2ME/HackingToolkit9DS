<- With this tool, you'll be able to: ->
- Extract and Rebuild any .3DS file
- Extract and Rebuild any .CIA file (No DLC nor DSiWare atm)
- Extract any .CXI file
- Extract and Rebuild a 3DS banner file (shown on the 3DS home menu)

- Extract any ncch partition from a .3DS decrypted file (CIA support soon)

<- Before report an issue, be sure: ->
- Your 3DS/CIA/CXI file(s) doesn't have any space or special caracter in their names (such as é or à)
- Your 3DS/CIA/CXI file(s) are in the same folder as HackingToolkit3DS
- You're not trying to extract the rom the ProgramFiles folder (where installed core files are).
- To don't write the extension when asking for extract your game. Want extract "Game.cia"? Just write "Game".
- To have installed the Setup package for your langage.
