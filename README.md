With this tool, you'll be able to:<br>
- Extract and Rebuild any .3DS file (previously decrypted using Decrypt9WIP and my tutorial)
- Extract and Rebuild any .CIA file (previously decrypted using Decrypt9WIP and my tutorial) (No DLC nor DSiWare atm)
- Extract any .CXI file (previously dumped using Braindump and my tutorial)
- Extract and Rebuild a 3DS banner file (shown on the 3DS home menu)
- Mass Decrypt and Mass Rebuild any .3DS and .CIA files in the same time. Yes, sir.
- Extract any ncch partition from a .3DS decrypted file (soon CIA support too)
- Extract datas from a decrypted ncch binary file

Before report an issue, be sure:
- Your 3DS/CIA/CXI files are fully decrypted
- Your 3DS/CIA/CXI files doesn't have any space or special caracter in their names (such as é or à)
- To don't write the extension when asking for extract your game. Want extract "Game.cia"? Just write "Game".
- To have installed the Setup package for your langage.

Are included some shortcuts of:
- 3DS Builder
- Pokemon XY/ORAS Patch Pointer Tool (code.bin patching, related to custom updates)
- RomFS Builder
- RomFS Extractor

Like that you don't have to take them in any folder or search for them.<br>
Just call them using the right keys (check the main menu) and they will appear.
